- Used **tw-merge** and **Tailwind Variants** to create reusable components.
- Deep understanding of Tailwind CSSâ€™s core concepts, improving development speed and efficiency.

**Mapbox**

- Migrated from **Leaflet to Mapbox** for better asset visualization (~3000 locations).
- Improved performance for rendering markers and connections, reducing zoom-in/out lag.
- Enhanced user experience with smoother interactions.

### **ShadCN**

- Replaced **MUI** with **ShadCN** for lightweight, customizable components.
- Improved flexibility and development speed.

**Feature Flags**

- Implemented feature flags for **continuous delivery** and **fast feedback loops**.
- Delivered incremental updates, demoed frequently, and iterated based on user feedback.
- Strengthened communication and customer-centric development.

**A/B Testing**

- Introduced a **toggle button** for users to test the new UI alongside the old version.
